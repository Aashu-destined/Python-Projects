This is a simple Python program mimicking the popular Indian quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC). In this game, players will answer a series of multiple-choice questions, with the difficulty increasing as the game progresses. The game also includes a virtual prize structure similar to that of the show.

Features
    Multiple-choice questions with 4 options for each question.
    Increasing difficulty as the player progresses.
    Virtual prize money based on the number of correct answers.
    Lifelines (e.g., 50:50, Audience Poll, etc.) (optional, depending on your implementation).
    Prerequisites
    Python 3.x or higher.
    No external libraries are required (unless implementing advanced features like lifelines or saving game progress).
